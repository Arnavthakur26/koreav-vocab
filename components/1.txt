PROMPT FOR V0:

Create a sophisticated mobile-first vocabulary practice web app for Korean learning with award-winning 3D design and effortless elegant,premium and seamless animations.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY:

   Three screens: Session Start → Quiz Cards → Session Statistics
   Quiz mechanic: Display a Korean word with 4 multiple-choice translations, reveal if correct/incorrect with visual feedback, then show the correct translation with an AI-generated example sentence
   Session tracking: Start session button, track correct/incorrect answers, end session button, then display detailed analytics
   Multiple difficulty levels: TOPIK 1 & 2 with separate word lists (20 words each)
   Fixed floating "Next Word" button that stays at bottom-right of screen viewport (never requires scrolling)
   Score counter in header showing current progress (e.g., "5/10")

DESIGN SYSTEM:

Typography:

   Headings: Space Grotesk (bold, 600-700 weight, tight letter spacing)
   Body: Inter (400-500 weight, relaxed line height 1.6)
   Korean words: Display at 48-64px with bold weight
   Romanization: 14px muted color below main word
   Smooth font rendering with -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased

Spacing & Layout:

   Mobile-first design optimized for phone screens
   Generous padding (24-32px) on all cards
   Rounded corners: rounded-3xl (24px) on all cards and buttons
   Use flexbox for layouts with gap utilities
   Bento grid layouts on start and stats screens with varying card sizes

3D DESIGN ELEMENTS:

Card Effects:
   Multi-layered shadows for dramatic depth:
   Cards have subtle 3D tilt on hover/tap (rotateX: 2deg, rotateY: 3deg)
   Glassmorphism: backdrop-blur-xl with 90% opacity white background
with 3d textures in background
   Subtle gradient overlays from edges to center
   Clear separation from background.

Background Elements:

   3-4 large floating orbs in background with:
       Gradient fills (purple to blue)
       Continuous rotation (20-40s duration)
       Blur effect (blur-3xl)
       Slow floating motion with different speeds
       Very subtle opacity (0.05-0.15) to avoid distraction
       Different sizes (200-400px)

Decorative Textures:

   Subtle geometric glyphs in card corners (circles, squares, triangles inspired by Korean traditional patterns)
   Glyphs fade from corners toward center (opacity-10 to opacity-0)
   Gentle rotation animation on glyphs (360deg over 20s)
   SVG patterns with stroke-only style, no fill

ANIMATIONS & MICRO-INTERACTIONS:

Global Animation Principles:

   Use Framer Motion for all animations
   Spring physics: { type: "spring", stiffness: 300, damping: 30 }
   Stagger children animations by 0.1s for sequential reveals
   All transforms use transform-gpu for hardware acceleration
   Smooth easing: ease-out for entrances, ease-in-out for movements

Button Interactions:

   Option buttons: Quick ripple wave (expanding circle) + horizontal shimmer sweep on tap (350ms total)
   Correct answer: Green glow with pulsing ring, scale to 1.05, rotate slightly
   Wrong answer: Red glow with shake animation (-5deg to 5deg)
   Hover/Active states: Scale 1.05, lift shadow, brighten colors
   Text turns white on hover/active for all interactive buttons
   All buttons have pulsing ambient glow rings

Screen Transitions:

   Cards fade in with spring animation from translateY: 50px
   Elements stagger in sequentially (0.1s delays)
   Exit animations: fade out with scale 0.95
   Smooth cross-fade between screens (300ms)

Micro-Animations:

   Icons gently float and rotate continuously
   Text reveals with slight fade-up motion
   Score counter animates when numbers change (spring scale)
   Success/celebration: Trophy bounces with floating sparkle particles
   Statistics cards pop in with spring scale and rotate effects
   Floating particles around interactive elements (very subtle, 3px size, slow drift)

COMPONENT STRUCTURE:

Session Start Screen:

   Large hero section with app title in Korean character
   Subtitle explaining purpose
   Bento grid below with:
       Large "Start Session" button (full width or prominent)
       Smaller info cards showing features or tips (2x2 grid)
       Cards vary in size for visual interest
   Level selector (tab-style) at top to choose difficulty
   Theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in header
   Decorative floating elements in background

Vocabulary Quiz Card:

   Top header: Score (left), End Session button (right)
   Main card floating in center with:
       Korean word (large, centered, bold)
       Romanization below (small, muted)
       4 option buttons in 2x2 grid with generous spacing
       After answering: Correct/incorrect feedback banner, then reveal section with:
           Correct translation (18px, bold)
           Example sentence section with AI loader (elegant SVG path animation - rotating book with sparkles, 2s duration)
           Example sentence appears after loader completes
   Fixed floating "Next Word" button at bottom-right of viewport:
       Circular button (56px diameter)
       Animated SVG arrow that draws in
       Pulsing ring effect
       Only appears after answering
       Uses fixed positioning (fixed bottom-8 right-8 z-50)

   "Start New Session" button at bottom
   Each stat card has 3D pop-in animation with rotation

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:

Tech Stack:

   Next.js 16 with App Router
   React 19
   TypeScript
   Tailwind CSS v4 (configured in globals.css @theme)
   Framer Motion for animations
   shadcn/ui components (Button, Card) OR HeroUI(NextUI) for better animated components- your choice
   Lucide React for icons

Key Files Structure:

    app/
      page.tsx (main app with state management)
      layout.tsx (fonts: Inter + Space Grotesk)
      globals.css (design tokens, 3D styles, animations)
    components/
      session-start.tsx (start screen with bento grid)
      vocabulary-card.tsx (main quiz component)
      session-stats.tsx (analytics with 3D animations)
      level-selector.tsx (TOPIK level tabs)
      theme-toggle.tsx (dark mode switch)
      example-loader.tsx (AI loading animation)
    lib/
      vocabulary-data.ts (word lists for both levels)
    types/
      session.ts (TypeScript interfaces)
    

State Management:

   useState for screen state ('start' | 'session' | 'stats')
   Track sessionData: correct answers, incorrect answers, total questions
   Track current word index, selected answer, show result state
   Level selection state 

Example Sentence API:

   Create fake loader that simulates 2s delay
   Placeholder for future Gemini API integration
   Shows elegant SVG path animation (rotating book icon with sparkles)
   Example appears after loader completes

Mobile Optimizations:

   touch-action: manipulation on all buttons
   Larger tap targets (min 44x44px)
   No hover-dependent interactions
   PWA manifest for home screen installation
   Viewport meta tags preventing zoom
   Hardware-accelerated transforms (transform-gpu)
   Reduced motion support with prefers-reduced-motion

DARK MODE:

   Toggle in header (sun/moon icon)
   Stored in localStorage
   Dark backgrounds: Deep charcoal with subtle purple tint
   Cards: Dark with purple-blue gradient overlays
   Text: Soft white with good contrast
   Floating orbs: More vibrant in dark mode
   All shadows adjusted for dark backgrounds

KEY DESIGN DETAILS TO NOT MISS:

1.  Elements must have continuous animations at all times but they should be elegant and subtle not too flashy or distracting
2.  Multi-layered shadows (3 layers) for dramatic 3D depth
3.  Subtle glyphs in corners fading to center inspired by Korean traditional patterns
4.  Fixed next button at viewport bottom-right (never inside scrolling content)
5.  Very subtle background orbs (opacity 0.05-0.15) to avoid distraction
6.  Button animations complete quickly (350ms) for seamless flow
7.  Celebratory sparkles and particles on stats screen for motivation
8.  Glassmorphism effect on all floating cards
9.  Spring physics on all animations for natural feel
10.  Stagger animations for sequential element reveals
11.  Text turns white on button hover/active states
12.  Trophy bounces and sparkles on stats screen
13.  Example loader is elegant SVG path animation (book + sparkles)
14.  Score counter in header, not embedded in card
15. All SVGs are subtly animated:
16. No animation is too flashy or distracting. Should be - effortlessly elegant and premium 
17. What I want from the Color palette:
    1.Premium 2.Mature 3.Simplistic 4.Elegant 5.Modern
18.  since I will be mainly using the app as a webapp on a mobile, add animations that can be seen on mobiles.For example - animations on svgs, and animations on clicks/taps since hover animation do not play in mobiles. Also prepare this app as a progressive webapp, so prepare a manifest.json

IMPORTANT!!! : Prioritize dark mode, minimalism inspired by asian(Korean) culture, effortless elegance

WORD LIST STRUCTURE: Create multiple arrays in lib/vocabulary-data.ts for each difficulty:



Each word object: { word: string, translation: string, romanization: string }

FINAL POLISH:

   Every element should have some subtle animation or micro-interaction
   The app should feel alive, encouraging, and motivating to use
   Visual feedback for all actions (clicks, correct/wrong answers, session complete)
   Clean, minimalistic aesthetic despite rich 3D effects
   Optimized for daily mobile practice sessions
   Balance between exciting visuals and non-distracting learning environment
